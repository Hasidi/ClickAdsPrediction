# ClickAdsPrediction

Data represents ads bid in android phones apps. 
The target variable is whether the user clicked the ad or not.

Feature extraction examples: 

	- Retrieve app category based on app name by querying google store.
	- Split UTC time to features like day of the week and part of day (e.g. night, morning..) 
	- Split USA states (given in dataset) to time zones regions.
